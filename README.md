# JS Mini Challenge: Event Handling

## Instructions

Fork this repo, then run `git clone` to download it locally. Then `cd` into the downloaded directory and open it in your text editor with `code .`.

## Submitting

When you’re finished, run the following commands in your terminal to submit:

```
git add .
git commit -m 'Done'
git push
```

To get feedback on your code, make a [pull request from your forked repo](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork). If you worked with a partner, you can tag your partner on the pull request.

## Assignment

In this challenge, we're going to keep working on Ian's Liverpool fan page and give our users the ability to:

- Toggle the header color
- Add a new goal video
- 'Like' a player 

We've got some starter code already written for us (this should look somewhat familiar from the previous challenge - feel free to use the code you wrote for the previous challenge instead). Your job is to add some additional functionality to make our app more dynamic by handling user interactions.

There's a section in this Readme file for your notes on each deliverable. As you go through the deliverables, write down some notes in this file on how you solved each problem. It'll help reinforce what you learned and give you a head start next time you see a similar problem.

## Deliverable 1: Toggle Header

**When a user clicks the header**, the color should toggle between black and red. 

To get you started, there's a helper function already written takes in an element and toggles its color that you can use. You can try it out in your console:

```js
toggleColor(document.querySelector("h1#header"))
```

Try calling it a few times to see the color switch back and forth. 

Once you have it working in the console, write an event listener that will use this helper function to change the color of the header when a user clicks on it.

**YOUR NOTES**
```
Opened my conosle in the browswer found header. Set a variable for the header. Updated toggle color function to reference the target. Finished with an event listener to the header , so when its clicked on itll go back and forth between colors.
```

## Deliverable 2: Like Button

**When a user clicks the like button for a player**, that player's likes should increase by 1. The likes won't persist (if you refresh the page, they'll reset to their original value) - we'll add persistence in the next challenge.

**YOUR NOTES**
```
Used video for donations/likes as a reference. Found button for like , added the event listener so when clicked on. Needed to parse to int since can not add int to string than push it into the text content for popularity( The number of likes he now has).

```

## Deliverable 3: Add a New Goal Video

Our app is already displaying some great goals for the player (check out the starter code in `index.js` to see how the initial render is set up), but we want our users to have the ability to add additional goals by entering a link in the `form#new-goal-form`.

**When a user submits the form**, the new goal should be displayed in the goal list (you can use the `renderGoal` helper function from the starter code if you like - it takes in an object with: { id, link, description }).

The data won't persist (when you refresh the page, the new goal won't show up) - we'll see how to fix this later on. For now, focus on getting the goal on the page when the form is submitted!

You're encouraged to seek out a goal video on YouTube, but if you'd like, here's an example goal you can use for testing purposes:

- Link: https://youtu.be/6rmUwoM-KQs?t=131
- Description: What a hat trick! Amazing pace and dribbling for Salah's third goal of the game.

Some things to keep in mind:

- Make sure you're using the form *submit* event, not the *click* event.
- If you see the page refresh, consider adding some code to *prevent* the *default* behavior of a form submitting.
- You can use the `name` attribute of the input elements as an easy way to reference the input fields within the form. For example: `document.querySelector("#new-goal-form").link` will look inside the `form#new-goal-form` and return the `input` element with the `name='link'` attribute
- Once you have access to an input field, you still need to retrieve its *value* to see what the user entered in the form!

**YOUR NOTES**
```
Again referenced videos. Those videos are amzing. Queryselector for new goal form. Added eventlistener for goal form where submit, my function. Added prevent default so page will not redirect. Got values for link and description , created a goal object with the need atributes. Rendered it .Added reset so that the text field is blank again after submitting. Thanks for the video to use.
